`Certara.R` provides a collection of packages and Shiny applications designed for Pharmacometric workflows in R.  All Shiny applications provide the ability to generate R code given point-and-click operations, enabling a reproducible and extensible workflow from Shiny GUI to RStudio.

### Installation and Running information

``` r
# Example (not yet on CRAN)
install.packages("Certara.R")

Certara.R::install_certara_packages()
```


### RsNLME <img src='vignettes/img/RsNLME.png' align="right" height="150" />

[`Certara.RsNLME`](https://certara.github.io/R-RsNLME/index.html) uses [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) syntax to build Non-Linear-Mixed-Effects (NLME) models in R. Create and execute NLME models using built-in R functions, or execute models with [PML](https://www.certara.com/training/pml-school/) code used in [Phoenix PK/PD Platform](https://www.certara.com/software/phoenix-pkpd/).

### RsNLME.ModelBuilder <img src='vignettes/img/ModelBuilder.png' align="left" height="150" style = "padding-right: 10px" />

[`Certara.RsNLME.ModelBuilder`](https://certara.github.io/R-RsNLME-model-builder/index.html) is an R package and Shiny application used to build an RsNLME model.

Use the GUI to select from various model building options and observe the PML update in real time. Additionally, users may generate the corresponding RsNLME code to learn reproduce the model object from R.

### RsNLME.ModelExecutor <img src='vignettes/img/ModelExecutor.png' align="right" height="150" />

[`Certara.RsNLME.ModelExecutor`](https://certara.github.io/R-RsNLME-model-executor/index.html) is an R package and Shiny application used to execute an RsNLME model.

Use the GUI to add additional output tables, specify engine parameters, select various run types, and more!

### ModelResults <img src='vignettes/img/ModelResults.png' align="left" height="150" style = "padding-right: 10px"/>

[`Certara.ModelResults`](https://certara.github.io/R-model-results/index.html) is an R package and Shiny GUI used to generate, customize, and report model diagnostic plots and tables from NLME or NONMEM runs.

Users are not limited by the GUI however, Certara.ModelResults will generate the underlying `flextable` and `xpose`/`ggplot2` code (`.R` and/or `.Rmd`) for you inside the Shiny application, which you can then use to recreate your plot and table objects in R, ensuring reproducibility and trace-ability of model diagnostics for reporting output.

---

<br/><br/>

### XposeNLME <img src='vignettes/img/XposeNLME.png' align="right" height="150"/>

[`Certara.Xpose.NLME`](https://certara.github.io/R-Xpose-NLME/index.html) is an R package used to creates `xpose` databases (`xpose_data`) for PML/NLME results. Additionally, [`Certara.Xpose.NLME`](https://certara.github.io/R-Xpose-NLME/index.html) offers various covariate model diagnostic functions, not available in the `xpose` package.

<br/><br/>

### VPCResults <img src='vignettes/img/VPCResults.png' align="left" height="150" style = "padding-right: 10px"/>

[`Certara.VPCResults`](https://certara.github.io/R-VPCResults/index.html) is an R package and Shiny application used to parameterize and plot a Visual Predictive Check (VPC).

Use the GUI to select from various binning or binless methods and specify options such as censoring, stratification, and prediction-corrected.

Users are not limited by the GUI however, [`Certara.VPCResults`](https://certara.github.io/R-VPCResults/index.html) will generate the underlying `tidyvpc` and `ggplot2` code (`.R` and/or `.Rmd`) for you inside the Shiny application, which you can then use to recreate your plot and table objects in R, ensuring reproducibility of VPCâ€™s for reporting output.

<br/><br/>

### tidyvpc <img src='vignettes/img/tidyvpc.png' align="right" height="150" />

The [`tidyvpc`](https://certara.github.io/tidyvpc/index.html) package is used to perform a Visual Predictive Check (VPC), while accounting for stratification, censoring, and prediction correction. 

Using piping from 'magrittr', the intuitive syntax gives users a flexible and powerful method to generate VPCs using both traditional binning and a new binless approach Jamsen et al. (2018) [doi:10.1002/psp4.12319](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6202468/) with Additive Quantile Regression (AQR) and Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) prediction correction.
