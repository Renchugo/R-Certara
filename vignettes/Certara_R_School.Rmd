Certara R School is a series of guided webinars, exercises, and interactive tutorials for the application of R in Pharmacometrics. 

Why R? R is the primary programming language in the Pharmacometrician's toolkit and offers unparalleled efficiency, flexibility, and reproducibility compared to working inside a GUI alone.  Learning R can be challenging at first, but Certara is here to help!

The following lessons will demonstrate how to begin using R in your Pharmacometric workflow. We will cover everything from installation/environment setup to creating interactive dashboards to communicate your analysis – let’s get started!
